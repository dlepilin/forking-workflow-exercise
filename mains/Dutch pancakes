Dutch Pancakes

NGREDIENTS
Pancake Batter
2 cups all-purpose flour 250 g
pinch of salt
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar optional
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon optional
2 eggs
2 cups milk 500 ml
1/2 tablespoon oil optional


INSTRUCTIONS
Mix flour, salt, sugar and cinnamon in a bowl. Make a little well in the middle and add the eggs and while whisking, add milk.

Switch to using a hand blender and mix. Add the oil and mix till you've got a smooth batter. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Put a frying pan on the stove at medium heat and add butter to a pan. Using a ladle, pour pancake batter into the pan. While pouring the batter, make sure you tilt the pan so you'll cover the entire bottom of the pan and get a thin pancake.

When the pancake starts to dry out on top the pancake can be flipped. Bake the pancake till golden on both sides.

Continue baking pancakes till the batter is finished.

Serve the pancakes hot or cold with any topping of your choosing. Put the topping on the pancake, roll it up and it's ready to be eaten.
